# Rust Model Generator

This is the rust version of the Model generator you are going to find in the Tools repository.

I started learning rust and I believe that the best way of getting comfortable with a programming language is building something with it.

This project represents a challange as the business is highly technical and writing code that it easy to read and mantain (especially naming the variables) is dificult.
